# Fast `cargo install` action

This GitHub Action installs a Rust crate using precompiled signed binaries built
on GitHub and hosted as GitHub release artifacts.

jobs:
  expand:
    name: cargo expand
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: dtolnay/install@master
        with:

      - run: cargo expand --help
```

## Security

Binaries are cryptographically signed and verified using [GitHub artifact
attestation] to establish the build's provenance, including the specific
workflow file and workflow run that produced the artifact.
